                                            The documentary 'Vamizi - Cradle of Coral' was initiated to help promote local and, in particular, national awareness of the unique biodiversity and 
                                            beauty of the marine environment of the northern Quirimbas. It was also used to promote awareness of the area at an international level. The film was produced by 
                                            Maryanne Culpepper, an award-winning producer/writer at National Geographic Television where she served as Head of Development and later, President. Wildlife photographer 
                                            Mattias Klum served as the director and writer of the documentary. He brings a unique artistic vision to his portrayal of animals, plants, and natural and cultural 
                                            settings. Klum has been named WWF ambassador, IUCN ambassador and National Geographic Fellow. In 2013 he was awarded an Honorary Doctorate degree in Natural 
                                            Science by Stockholm University. 
                                            
                                            Together they created a feature length film which looks at Vamizi's fragile eco-system and the efforts being made to save it. The film reveals an 
                                            amazing place few have ever seen - a place in danger of vanishing forever.<br><br>

                                        <strong>Project description</strong><br>
                                        Vamizi is the largest island in the Quirimbas Archipelago. Its relative isolation from mainland Mozambique has preserved 
                                        its natural beauty and wildlife. It has magnificent coral reefs and is a unique breeding ground for whales, dolphins, turtles and sharks. 
                                        This reef is also the only place in East Africa where "mass spawning" has been observed among corals, which means they are healthy and help
                                        other corals, near and far, to reproduce and grow as well as stabilize the ecosystems around it. This fragile realm is however under threat. 
                                        The film follows a team of scientists from around the world who fight to stop the damage before it starts, accompanied by stunning imagery from 
                                        renowned National Geographic photographer Mattias Klum.

                                        <strong>Making of Vamizi - Cradle Of Coral</strong><br>
                                        Being a diver for many years prior to my engineering career, I came into contact with the project from underwater photographer Eric Börjeson (https://ericborjeson.com/) 
                                        with whom I had previously worked as a safety diver during several film projects. The project would be heavily focused on underwater imagery and needed a second safety diver. 
                                        I was recommended by Eric
                                        who had previously collaborated with Mattias Klum. After discussions with Mattias Klum and his production company Tierra Grande, I was hired to join the project. 
                                        The preparations were extensive. A total of 60 boxes of filming and diving equipment were carried by a crew of 5 people from Stockholm, Sweden, through Dar-Es Salaam,
                                        Tanzania and on to Vamizi Island, Mozambique. 

                                        In Vamizi, I was together with the filming crew for almost 1 month. We spend every day underwater, usually morning and evening. During the dives, us safety divers would 
                                        accompany the directory of photography underwater. Our main task was to ensure the safety of the photographer, as filming requires a lot of equipment and concentration,
                                        which increases the risk of accidents. The secondary task for the safety divers was to serve as a assistant photographer, sometimes rigging camera equipment or underwater lights and
                                        sometimes even being behind the camera. During the dives, we filmed a lot of species of coral and marine life. There were also other scenes filmed under water, such as the breaching
                                        of humpback whales, dolphins and turtles. 
                                        
                                        The most unique scene however was filming the mass spawning of corals. Once a year, a coral species called the "blue coral" spawns. This
                                        usually occurs between one week before and one week after the full moon in September in Vamizi. The spawning is a spectacular event, where the blue coral releases millions of
                                        eggs and sperm into the water, creating a mesmerizing spectacle. However, it only takes place at night. This mean that the filming crew had to be on night dives every night for 2 weeks,
                                        with full filming equipment. Timing the event was crucial and very difficult, which is the reason why it had never been caught on film before. However, we managed to film the spectacular
                                        event, which is featured in the film.

                                        We also filmed a lot of scenes on land, such as the local people and their culture, the local wildlife and much more.

                                        <p>
                                            This project provided me with invaluable experience in advanced materials research and device fabrication for stretchable electronics. 
                                            I gained deep insights into the emerging field of printed electronics, particularly focusing on stretchable energy storage devices.
                                            My understanding of material science expanded significantly, especially in formulating and optimizing conductive inks and electrolytes 
                                            for specific applications.
