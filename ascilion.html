                                        <strong>Work description</strong><br>
                                        After working roughly 3 years at Ascilion, the design and development phase of the product was complete. The next step was to integrate the product into customer applications. This involved a lot of customer interaction,
                                        for example to understand the customer's needs and to provide support. This also involved a lot of travel, both domestically and internationally. This also coincided with the regulatory path of the product,
                                        leading me into the unknown world of medical device regulation (MDR) and the path to compliance.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        <strong>Regulatory compliance</strong><br>
                                        As I had been heavily involved on the development side of the product, I became responsible for parts of the compliance of specific standards. These included IEC 60601 (electrical safety) and IEC 62304
                                        (software life cycle processes). The IEC 60601 standard requires the product to go through heavy scrutiny in terms of design and safety testing, of which I was the project manager. This entailed interacting
                                        with the testing body for continous dialogue and managing the complex web of requirements. This also included the development of a risk management plan, which was a large part of my work. On the software side,
                                        my main task was to ensure that the software complied with the IEC 62304 standard. This included the development of a thorough test plan and requirements specification.

                                        <br>
                                        <strong>Other areas of responsibility included:</strong><br>
                                        In this role, I started traveling to our customers more, especially in Europe and in the U.S. I got involved in the business development side more, which meant that I was not simply traveling to customers
                                        to train them on our device, but also to learn about their needs and in what way I could facilitate a further collaboration. This resulted in learning about many diverse fields of which I had no prior knowledge,
                                        and learning how to listen to customers and understand their needs. <br>
                                        <br>
                                    
                                        <strong>What I learned in this role:</strong><br>
                                        I learned many things about the complex world of medical device regulations, as well as about project and stakeholder management, and how to go from start to finish in a project. It also allowed me to become
                                        independent in my work, as I was responsible for a large part of the projects from start to finish. <br>

                                    <strong>Work description</strong><br>
                                    During my first years at Ascilion, I was responsible for taking a Medical Device from prototype stage to a product that could be delivered to customers and used in clinical applications. The work was divided into two parts:<br>
                                    <br>
                                    <strong>Hardware development</strong><br>
                                    A large part of my hardware development was to enable test setups for various components, ranging from mechanical testing of silicon features to optiacl inspecting. A lot of the hardware was
                                    built-in house by assembling components from various suppliers, or building components. It often involved some kind of microcontroller system, for automation or PC-enabled interaction by the operator. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    <strong>Software development</strong><br>
                                    To enable development in the lab and using test equipment for validation and automation setups, I developed software using a combination of SQL, C#, C++ and Python. The software often interacted with some 
                                    physical system, while some software was used for data acquisition and analysis, data visualization or using databases for data storage. The software that I developed also became part of the product, serving
                                    as the main GUI used together with Ascilion's dISF extraction tool PELSA. The software enabled the operator to control the device and view the data in a user-friendly way. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    <strong>Other areas of responsibility included:</strong><br>
                                    I was also responsible for designing and building a fully automated optical inspection tool to serve as the base for quality assurance of the product. This involved a large amount of programming, for example
                                    a 4-axis stage system and camera components anc for real-time image analysis. I was also heavily involved in design of experiments, for example in microfluidics and biology. Furthermore, I was responsible for 
                                    a large part of the incoming inspection of the silicon wafers, for example using SEM and LOM, for which I designed and manufactured customized tools. Other parts such as project management, product design, <br>
                                    documentation, regulatory work, cusomer support and training were also some of my duties. <br>
                                    <br>
                                
                                    <strong>What I learned in this role:</strong><br>
                                    I learned a great deal from this role. On the technical side, I learned a lot about the development of medical devices, from the design of experiments to the actual development of the product.
                                    I also learned a lot about programming, having to teach myself a lot of the software development that I did not know before. Other fields such as CAD (Solidworks) and 3D printing, plastic injection molding and 
                                    microfluidics were also areas in which I learned a lot. I also learned what it is like to work in a startup environment, with a small team and a lot of responsibility. <br>
