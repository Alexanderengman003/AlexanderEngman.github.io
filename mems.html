                                            My studies in nanotechnology with the focus on nanoelectronics had several interesting course projects. The project was carried out at the MST (Division of Micro and Nanosystems) at the 
                                            School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden. For the course EK2360 Hands-on MEMS Engineering,
                                             students carried out a project in the field of Microsystems engineering. The purpose of the project was to design, fabricate and evaluate a system for an optical switch. The system
                                             needed to be fabricated in silicon, should be movable in two directions and should have the possibility to be locked in to place at specific distances from the origin.<br><br>

                                        <strong>Project description</strong><br>
                                        For the course EK2360 Hands-on MEMS Engineering, students were tasked with 
                                        designing, fabricating, and evaluating a system for an optical switch. The requirements were that 
                                        the system should be fabricated in silicon, be movable in two directions, and have the capability 
                                        to be locked in place at specific distances from the origin. The design goal was to create a switch 
                                        that could move ±15 μm in either direction and be precisely controlled as well as locked within this range.
                                        The system should also be possible to control linearly, by adjusting the applied voltage to the electrodes.

                                    </p>
                                        <strong>Design</strong><br>
                                        The MEMS system design focused on an electrostatic actuation mechanism using a comb drive system. 
                                        This choice allowed for large displacement (±15 µm) and a stable control region. The spring system 
                                        consisted of folded springs with anchor points, providing flexibility in adjusting properties. 
                                        The spring constant k was a crucial parameter, responsible for defining the spring's properties in 
                                        the desired direction as well as in unwanted directions to prevent lateral instability or transverse motion.
                                        
                                        Two basic designs were simulated using COMSOL for FEM-analysis, iteratively refining the designs. 
                                        Important properties such as lateral and rotational stability, stable range of the actuator, and 
                                        spring constants were simulated and adjusted accordingly. Final designs were implemented in AutoCAD 
                                        for chip layout, accommodating about 50 individual devices, including devices from the mandatory designs 
                                        as well as the alternative device designs.

                                        <strong>Fabrication</strong><br>
                                        Fabrication began with a Silicon on Insulator (SOI) wafer, involving photoresist coating, mask 
                                        alignment, and UV patterning. Deep Reactive Ion Etching (DRIE) using the Bosch process created 
                                        precise structures. This process allowed for high aspect ratio etching, achieving 47μm deep trenches 
                                        with only 3.31μm diameter.
                                        
                                        Subsequent steps included wafer dicing, structure release using HF acid etch, critical point drying 
                                        to avoid stiction, and aluminum metallization for electrical contacts. The HF etch lasted about three 
                                        minutes at an etch rate of 1.5nm/min. Critical Point Drying (CPD) was used to avoid surface tension 
                                        forces and stiction of moving parts during the drying process.
                                        
                                        Post-fabrication inspection used Light Optical Microscopy (LOM) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), 
                                        revealing successful releases and some stuck structures. SEM imaging allowed for observation of 
                                        different parts of the device, including the locking mechanism, comb fingers, and spring system. 
                                        Measurements showed fabricated geometries were within ±1 µm of the design, with a tendency for 
                                        smaller features in areas with more etched space around them.

                                        <strong>Results</strong><br>
                                        Testing revealed varying yields across different designs. The main design showed 15% fully 
                                        functional devices when testing only actuation, increasing to 25% when testing both actuation 
                                        and locking mechanism. Secondary designs performed poorly, likely due to inferior rotational 
                                        stability. Common issues included stuck movable parts and partially functional locking mechanisms.
                                        
                                        Real-world devices required lower voltages than simulated (28.5V vs 65V) to operate the locking 
                                        mechanism, possibly due to under-etching or unaccounted pull-in effects. This discrepancy might 
                                        be attributed to the locking mechanism behaving similarly to a parallel plate actuator, where 
                                        pull-in occurs after moving 1/3 of the initial gap.
                                        
                                        Secondary designs (B and D) showed less stability, rotating at voltages above 50V, unlike the main design. 
                                        This instability was expected based on the simulation results. While some design parameters like 
                                        rotational and lateral stability couldn't be directly measured during characterization, the observed 
                                        behavior of the secondary designs aligned with the predicted lower rigidity and stability.

                                        <strong>What I learned from this project:</strong><br>
                                        <p>
                                            This project provided me with invaluable hands-on experience in MEMS design, fabrication, and characterization. 
                                            I gained deep insights into the challenges of creating microscale electromechanical systems, particularly 
                                            focusing on optical switches. My understanding of microfabrication techniques expanded significantly, 
                                            especially in areas such as photolithography, deep reactive ion etching, and critical point drying.
                                            <br><br>
                                            I learned to use advanced simulation tools like COMSOL Multiphysics to optimize designs before fabrication, 
                                            which proved crucial in predicting device behavior and improving performance. The project also enhanced my 
                                            skills in clean room protocols and microscopy techniques, including SEM imaging and analysis.
                                            <br><br>
                                            Furthermore, this experience taught me the importance of iterative design and the challenges of translating 
                                            theoretical designs into practical devices. I gained a deeper appreciation for the complexities involved in 
                                            MEMS fabrication, including the impact of small variations in the manufacturing process on device performance.
                                            <br><br>
                                            Overall, this project significantly improved my problem-solving skills in a research and development context, 
                                            teaching me to adapt and learn quickly when faced with unexpected results or fabrication challenges.
